# Disclaimer: This is not my code


The purpose of this project was to practice Java skills using  Software Architecture & Design's Chess Tutorial: Java Chess Programming )

Note: Many of the concepts in the video were quite advanced for me, but overall great learning experience.
Major points to take away:
- Design patterns, specifically Factory, Decorator and Observer
- Recursion
- Swing and JTabels (in terms of data) -> Model pattern
- Make sure to JUnit throughout project
- More work on Debugging
- Casting


Program still has several bugs - Ones I know of: detecting castling, minimax will enter infinite loop, checkmate notification not working.
